### About This Game

Your destiny beckons! Select your noble house and steer your dynasty towards greatness in an epic Middle Ages saga that unfolds across generations.

War is merely one of the many instruments required to secure your reign‚Äîtrue strategy demands diplomatic finesse, mastery over your domain, and inherent cunning.

**Crusader Kings III** continues the beloved series from Paradox Development Studio, featuring:

* Take charge of your house and broaden your dynasty in a richly detailed recreation of the Middle Ages. Start in either 867 or 1066, and seize lands, titles, and vassals to establish a realm worthy of your royal heritage. Remember, your life is just a chapter, as your lineage carries on through new heirs, whether planned‚Ä¶ or unplanned.
* Encounter a vast simulated world brimming with peasants, knights, courtiers, spies, jesters, and secret romances. An extensive array of historical figures await, ready to be romanced, betrayed, executed, or subtly influenced.
* Navigate an immense medieval map that stretches from the frostbitten Nordic territories to the Horn of Africa, encompassing the British Isles in the west and the exotic riches of Burma in the east. Claim, conquer, and govern thousands of unique counties, duchies, kingdoms, and empires.
